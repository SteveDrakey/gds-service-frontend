# GOV.UK service starter

An opinionated React + Vite prototype that demonstrates how to follow the Government Digital Service (GDS)
Design System. It includes:

- a GOV.UK themed layout powered by [`govuk-react`](https://github.com/govuk-react/govuk-react)
- routing via `react-router-dom`
- a three-step application form with shared state and a “Check your answers” page
- rich content explaining the GDS principles and links to official guidance

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit http://localhost:5173 to explore the prototype. Run `npm run build` to produce a production bundle.
